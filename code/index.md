## Code

The main code that runs the neural network can be found here

[neural network main code](https://github.com/angelajburden/QSO_neural_network/blob/master/neural_network_galaxy.py)

In this part of the code you can change the lambda (regularisation) parameter, the number of nodes in the hidden layers, the and number of iterations reuired to train the network.   
There are several functions commented out. These are the graient checking algorithm that checks the code is doing what it is meant to, the validaion curve algorithm that outputs the accuracy of the cross validation and training sets for different lambda values and the learning curve algorithm that outputs the cost function of the training and cross validation sample when the network is trained on different sized training data sets.

The actual functions are in this part of the code
